# codeHBS React Redux starter code

This repo contains starter code to build a web application using React/Redux. If you're new to Javascript coding, first thing you'll want to do is make sure you have node and the npm command line installed. Node is just server side Javascript, and npm is the way to install the necessary libraries and packages (e.g., react and redux) to get your code working. You can learn more about how to install node and the npm command line [here] (https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/).

Once you've got node installed, you'll need to [fork the codehbs-react repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to your own GitHub page. Forking will create a copy of the repository on your github profile. Navigate to this copy on your GitHub profile page, and [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to your desktop. After cloning the repo, cd into the directory on your command line and run the following commands:

`npm install` <-installs the necessary packages and dependencies

`npm start` <-starts the server

Open your brower to a new screen and navigate to localhost:8080. This is where the server is running locally and you should see "hey there codeHBS".

## Now let's add some functionality!
